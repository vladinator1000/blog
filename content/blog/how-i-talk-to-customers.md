# Outline

## 1. Looking for opportunities

- Why are we talking to customers?
- If you want to start a company, the best way to get ideas is organically. 1. Become an expert at something. 2. Work at a startup. 3. Build things you find interesting
- The other way is to talk to people and find how they feel and problems they have
- What personas are we looking for?
- Talk to both potential customers and other startup founders, they offer different kinds of insights
- A problem in search of solutions versus a solution in search of a problem.
- Making something you're curious about is OK, as long as it's to satisfy your curiosity, rather than being a solution desperately in search for a problem
- Picking an idea space before looking for who to talk to (to constrain the possibility space)
- What do you value, what do others value? Market size?
- Look for changes in the environment that have implications on problems you care about

## 2. Know thyself

- Understand yourself first
- Journaling and writing down your ideas
- Ask yourself: "Would you use this if you hadn't built it?"
- Founders are bad at realizing what their problems are and how to rank them
- Becoming contrarian in search of answers to counterintuitive questions
- The dangers of thinking that loneliness is the price of independence
- Getting lost in contrarianism (echo chambers, assholerism, a stopped analog clock is right 2 times a day)
- It's not all about being against the grain. If you have a contrarian opinion on a subject, it's about understanding how systems work and being able to support your reasoning with facts and logic
- Delusion and its emotional benefits vs. drawbacks
- Relatives asking about "will it work" (implying yes or no) instead of "How will it work?"

## 3. Listening

If there's one thing you should take away from this article is, that if you want advice on how to listen to other people, you should go to tech founders, because they are widely known for being good listeners. (satire, make it work)

- People won't share their valuable insight with someone they just met
- We need to earn their trust (ask dad how he did that)

(bit on improv actors here)

- Letting go of your ego
- Shutting the fuck up
- Yes, and
-

## 4. Conclusion

- Know yourself
- Pick an idea space
- Learn how to listen
- Find people in the idea space and learn about them and their problems

# Notes

## Notes on "What I've learned from users - Paul Graham"

- "Would you use this if you hadn't built it?"
- Founders are bad at realizing what their problems are
- Founders are bad at ranking their problems because startups are counterintuitive
- "...figure out which problems matter most, then cook up ideas for solving them — ideally at a resolution of a week or less — and then try those ideas and measure how well they worked. The focus is on action, with measurable, near-term results." (momentum)
- Focus is valuable for startups because it enables speed, making better use of limited resources

Vlady thoughts:

- a stopped clock is right 2 times a day. Some people resort to contrarianism in hopes of finding opportunities of being right. What are the perils of being contrarian for the sake of it? Community as an enticing factor to contrarianism, combined with the echo chamber effect.
- Community as an important factor of learning what questions to ask
- The dangers of thinking that loneliness is the price of independence
- How much delusion do you need? Also, how do you counter-balance it? (other systems such as stop loss)
- Relatives asking about "will it work" (implying yes or no) instead of "How will it work?"

## Notes on "How to get and evaluate startup ideas (video) - Jared Freidman"

- This feels mostly irrelevant to talking to users, "finding good ideas" sounds like a topic for a separate article
- Solution in search of a problem
- If you have a specific question (non open-ended), google it first
- Shopping for ideas in a fertile idea space
- If you want to start a company, the best way to get ideas is organically. 1. Become an expert at something. 2. Work at a startup. 3. Build things you find interesting

Jared does go into talking to other people but says it requires skill.

- Recommends to first pick a fertile idea space
- Talk to potential customers but also founders in the idea space to get advice about what ideas are worth pursuing
- Gives example about the company A2B, they picked "software for trucking" idea space, then went to truck stops and started interviewing truck drivers about their problems, also talked to founders in the trucking space. This way, they created a mental map of the idea space for trucking and noted where the good and bad ideas are before deciding what to work on.

If there's one thing you should take away from this article, is that if you want advice on how to listen to other people, you should go to startup founders first, because they are widely known for their listening ability.

## Notes on "How to actively listen to others - Scott Pierce"

It's not the note you play that's wrong, it's the note you play after that makes the first one right or wrong.
When Herbie Hancock played with Myles Davis, he played a chord that sounded bad, but what Myles played after made it sound good.

Author talks about improv and how improvisation is about listening, being present and accepting.
Rules of improv:

- Yes and (add more information to the scene)
- Don't deny
- Make your partner look good
- Avoid asking questions
- Use details
- Create a physical environment and play with it
- Learn, open up and become vulnerable
- Pause and breathe when confronted with something I want to deny
- When everyone in the conversation is present, the scene flows (group mind)
- If we attach expectations to things in life, they can become frustrating
- If we release expectations and let life flow through us, we have contemptment and peace
- "Emptiness is not nothingness, but a type of existence." A release of the expectations is not a denial of self, when you become empty this lets you be filled.

- The "and" of "yes, and" is action
- An offer is a line that an improviser throws at that's begging to be picked up and ran with. For example: "that's the last time I ran a marathon backwards"
- It doesn't matter what you say next, as long as you've accepted and said yes to the improvised circumstance
- If Myles didn't accept, Herbie's note would have became a mistake
- Be wholly present, drop expectations, accept the point of view that you struggle with, and then - act.

## Notes on "Valve's secret weapon"

- Shut up and observe
- Players are good at finding that something is wrong, but bad at solving it because they lack context
