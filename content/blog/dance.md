Memories are hard to reach 
it's pulling me down, making me breathe
Memories are hard to reach
It's pulling me down and making me breathe 

And I wish I could dance like you
Onto the ground and under the moon
And I wish I could dance like you
Onto the ground and under the moon

Memories hard to reach
It's not what it seems it's about these feelings
Memories are hard to reach
What should I feel when I don't believe

I got vibes but not much to say
So much to do and it doesn't quite come through
I got vibes and not much to say
But if I really should
It's that I kind of like you

Wish I could dance like you
Onto the ground and under the moon
And I wish I could dance like you
Under the ground and onto the moon
