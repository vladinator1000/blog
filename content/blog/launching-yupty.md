Today marks the launch of [Yupty](https://yupty.live) - a ticketing platform where artists set their split upfront and get paid automatically after the show.

## What makes it different

### Ticket splits

Event organizers (artists, venues, promoters) pre-negotiate splits. After the event finishes, participants receive their share in their bank account. No more chasing payments.

### Pricing

We're artists ourselves, so we came up with an artist-first pricing model.

Fans pay a small fee when buying tickets, *4.5% + 90p per transaction*. No monthly fees, or hidden fees. This is included in listed ticket prices.

We have a neat [pricing calculator that lets artists estimate their earnings.](https://preview.yupty.live/pricing/estimate?name-0=%22Ghostdial%22&split-0=40&name-1=%22Static+Bloom%22&split-1=30&name-2=%22August+house%22&split-2=5&name-3=%22Cinder+Presents%22&split-3=25&)

## Summary

Launching Yupty - find the live music you're missing.

Every now and then people ask me “Why the name?”. We’re from Glasgow, Scotland. It's the only name that could ever work.
