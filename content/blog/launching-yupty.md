Organizing live shows is hard.

- Booking venues takes ages - dealing with availability conflicts, venue terms, and figuring out if they have the right equipment takes time.
- Coordinating people is a pain - getting bands all in one place without someone bailing.
- Selling tickets is a full time job - getting fans to buy tickets, tracking everything, it's hard to predict if enough people will show up to cover your costs.
- Chasing payments - getting everyone's banking details, asking for invoices, not getting replies back for weeks, and finally getting paid months after a show - it's a real slog.

This keeps artists from focusing on what matters most - the music.

Introducing [Yupty](https://yupty.live) - a ticketing platform where artists set their revenue split upfront, and get paid automatically after the show.

Doug and I bootstrapped the company to help emerging artists get paid, keep local venue doors open, and make it easy for fans to find the live music they’re missing.

Here's what it can do.

### Ticket splits

Event organizers (artists, venues, promoters) pre-negotiate splits. After the event finishes, participants receive their share in their bank account. No more chasing payments.

### Pricing

We're artists ourselves, so we came up with an artist-first pricing model.

Fans pay a small fee when buying tickets, _4.5% + 90p per transaction_. No monthly fees, or hidden fees. This is included in listed ticket prices.

The fee is included in the ticket purchase price already. If a fan sees a ticket price of £12 and buys 2 tickets, they pay a total of £24 and we work out what to pay organizers from there.

We also have a neat [pricing calculator that lets artists estimate their earnings.](https://preview.yupty.live/pricing/estimate?name-0=%22Ghostdial%22&split-0=40&name-1=%22Static+Bloom%22&split-1=30&name-2=%22August+house%22&split-2=5&name-3=%22Cinder+Presents%22&split-3=25&)

Every now and then people ask me “Why the name?”. We’re from Glasgow, Scotland. It's the [only name that could ever work](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=yuptae).
