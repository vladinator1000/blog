Today marks the launch of [Yupty](https://yupty.live) - a ticketing platform where artists set their revenue split upfront, and get paid automatically after the show.

## What makes it different

### Mission statement: “Find the live music you’re missing.”

Doug and I built the company with our own funds, blood, sweat and tears. We avoided venture capital in order to help emerging artists get paid, keep local venue doors open, and make it easy for fans to find the live music they’re missing.

### Ticket splits

Event organizers (artists, venues, promoters) pre-negotiate splits. After the event finishes, participants receive their share in their bank account. No more chasing payments.

### Themes

### Pricing

We're artists ourselves, so we came up with an artist-first pricing model.

Fans pay a small fee when buying tickets, _4.5% + 90p per transaction_. No monthly fees, or hidden fees. This is included in listed ticket prices.

The fee is included in the ticket purchase price already. If a fan sees a ticket price of £12 and buys 2 tickets, they pay a total of £24 and we work out what to pay organizers from there.

We also have a neat [pricing calculator that lets artists estimate their earnings.](https://preview.yupty.live/pricing/estimate?name-0=%22Ghostdial%22&split-0=40&name-1=%22Static+Bloom%22&split-1=30&name-2=%22August+house%22&split-2=5&name-3=%22Cinder+Presents%22&split-3=25&)

## Summary

Every now and then people ask me “Why the name?”. We’re from Glasgow, Scotland. It's the [only name that could ever work](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=yuptae).
